#### Sports Radar Practicum
---
This repository contains source code and tests necessary for completing the Sports Radar Practicum located [here](https://github.com/sportradarus/super-bowl-rushing-leaders). Modules for completing the practicum may be found in the `lib/` directory.

My approach in completing this exercise was to create an object oriented design with functional, stateless solutions.

To run the program:

    npm install
    npm run-script sports-radar

To run the test suite:

    npm test

To generate the documentation:

    npm run-script docs

To do:

+ Handle edges case of properties not existing
+ Abstract the Rushes function to handle different play types
+ Create templating for documentation

Thank you for checking out the repository. I love ripping into giant data objects.

Talk to you soon,
Matt
